        **Request a standardized NHS Data Dictionary list**

        CheckTick maintains a curated collection of commonly-used NHS Data Dictionary standardized lists as global datasets. These are scraped from the official NHS Data Dictionary and made available to all users.

        Before requesting a new dataset, please:
        1. Check the [existing NHS DD datasets](https://github.com/eatyourpeas/checktick/blob/main/checktick_app/surveys/management/commands/sync_nhs_dd_datasets.py) to see if it's already available
        2. Search existing issues to avoid duplicates
        3. Consider if this is a commonly-needed list that would benefit multiple users

        **Note**: After approval, datasets are added to the seed command and will be available after the next deployment.

        **What happens next?**

        1. Maintainers review the request and verify the NHS DD page
        2. If approved, the dataset is added to the seed command with appropriate tags
        3. Dataset becomes available globally on next deployment
        4. You'll be notified when it's live

        **Alternative**: If you need this urgently, you can create a custom dataset in your organization and we can help you populate it. Once the NHS DD version is added, you can switch to using that instead.
