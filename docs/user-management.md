# User management and permissions

This document explains how organization- and survey-level user management works across SSR (server-rendered UI) and the API, including roles, permissions, endpoints, and security protections. The app follows a single-organisation admin model and enforces username=email.

## Account Types

There are two types of users in the system:

- **Individual users**: Users who create surveys without an organization. Individual users can only create and manage their own surveys and **cannot share surveys or invite collaborators**.
- **Organization users**: Users who belong to an organization. Organization users can collaborate on surveys within their organization, with permissions managed by organization admins.

## Roles and scopes

There are two membership scopes with separate roles:

- Organization membership (OrganizationMembership)
  - admin: Full administrative control over the organization context, including managing org members and managing surveys within the organization.
  - creator: Can create and manage their own surveys; read-only visibility to organization content is up to app policy, but creators do NOT manage org members.
  - viewer: Read-only role for organization context where applicable; cannot manage org members.

- Survey membership (SurveyMembership) - **Only available for organization surveys**
  - creator: Can manage members for that specific survey and edit the survey.
  - viewer: Can view the survey content and results according to app policy; cannot manage survey members.

Additional implicit authorities:

- Survey owner: For organization surveys, always has full control over the survey, including member management for that survey.
- Organization admin: Has admin rights for surveys that belong to their organization, including member management.

Single-organisation model:

- A user can be an ADMIN of at most one organisation. The “User management” hub focuses on that single org context.

## Permission matrix (summary)

- Manage org members (add/update/remove): Organization admin only
- Manage survey members (add/update/remove): **Organization surveys only** - Survey owner, organization admin (if the survey belongs to their org), or survey creator for that survey
- View survey: Owner, org admin (if applicable), any survey member (creator/viewer)
- **Individual users**: Cannot share surveys or manage survey members

Guardrails:

- Organization admins cannot remove themselves from their own admin role via the SSR UI or the API. Attempts are rejected.
- Individual users (surveys without organization) cannot access user management endpoints or share their surveys.
- SSR UI supports email-based lookup and creation for convenience. The API endpoints expect explicit user IDs for membership resources; scoped user creation endpoints exist to create a user in a given org or survey.

## SSR management pages

**Note**: User management pages are only accessible for organization surveys. Individual users cannot share their surveys or access these pages.

- Organisation hub: `/surveys/manage/users/`
  - Shows the single organisation you manage, all its users, and users grouped by surveys.
  - Quick-add forms let you add users to the organisation or to a survey by email and role.
  - Prevents an org admin from removing themselves as an admin.
  - Actions are audit-logged.

- Organization users: `/surveys/org/<org_id>/users/`
  - Admins can add or update members by email, change roles, and remove users. Non-admins receive 403.
  - Actions are audit-logged.

- Survey users: `/surveys/{slug}/users/`
  - **Only available for organization surveys**. Individual users cannot access this page.
  - Owners, org admins (if the survey belongs to their org), and survey creators can add/update/remove survey members.
  - Survey viewers see a read-only list.
  - Actions are audit-logged.

## API endpoints

Authentication: All endpoints below require JWT. Include "Authorization: Bearer <access_token>".

### Organization memberships

- List: GET /api/org-memberships/
- Create: POST /api/org-memberships/
- Update: PUT/PATCH /api/org-memberships/{id}/
- Delete: DELETE /api/org-memberships/{id}/

Scope and permissions:

- Queryset is restricted to organizations where the caller is an admin.
- Create/Update/Delete require admin role in the target organization.
- Delete: additionally prevents an org admin from removing their own admin membership.
- Unauthorized or out-of-scope access returns 403 Forbidden. Missing/invalid JWT returns 401 Unauthorized.

Serializer fields:

- id, organization, user, username (read-only), role, created_at (read-only)

### Survey memberships

**Note**: Survey memberships are only available for organization surveys. Individual users cannot create or manage survey memberships.

- List: GET /api/survey-memberships/
- Create: POST /api/survey-memberships/
- Update: PUT/PATCH /api/survey-memberships/{id}/
- Delete: DELETE /api/survey-memberships/{id}/

Scope and permissions:

- Queryset contains only memberships for surveys the caller can view (owner, org-admin for the survey's org, or the caller is a member of the survey).
- Create/Update/Delete require manage permission on the survey (owner, org admin for the survey's org, or survey creator).
- **Individual users (surveys without organization) will receive 403 Forbidden when attempting to manage memberships.**
- Unauthorized or out-of-scope access returns 403; missing/invalid JWT returns 401.

Serializer fields:

- id, survey, user, username (read-only), role, created_at (read-only)

### Scoped user creation

To support flows where an admin/creator wants to add a person who may not yet exist:

- Create user within an org context (org admin only):
  - POST /api/scoped-users/org/{org_id}/create

- Create user within a survey context (survey owner/org admin/creator):
  - POST /api/scoped-users/survey/{survey_id}/create
  - **Only available for organization surveys. Individual users will receive 403 Forbidden.**

Request schema:

- email (string, required)
- password (string, optional)

Behavior:

- If a user with the given email already exists, it is reused; otherwise a new user is created with username=email. Password is required only when creating a new user (optional if reusing).
- On success, returns the user's id/username/email and adds them as a Viewer in the specified scope by default (org Viewer or survey Viewer).
- Permission checks mirror the membership rules above. Unauthorized attempts receive 403.

Note: The SSR UI allows searching by email and will create or reuse users accordingly, with audit logging. If you need similar behavior via API, use the scoped user creation endpoints described here.

## Audit logging

Membership actions performed via the SSR UI are recorded in AuditLog with:

- actor, scope (organization or survey), organization/survey context, action (add/update/remove), target_user, metadata (e.g., role), timestamp

These records enable traceability of who changed which memberships and when.

## Security notes

- JWT is required for API access. Missing/invalid tokens result in 401; valid tokens without sufficient privileges result in 403.
- SSR uses session auth with CSRF protection and enforces permissions via centralized helpers.
- Organization admins cannot remove themselves as admins via the UI or the API; requests to remove self-admin are rejected.
- Sensitive demographics remain encrypted per-survey and are unaffected by membership operations.

### Account Deletion Security

For security and data integrity reasons, account deletion is restricted:

- **User account deletion**: Only superusers can delete user accounts through the Django Admin interface (`/admin/`).
- **Regular users cannot delete their own accounts** to prevent accidental data loss and maintain audit trails.
- **Organization deletion**: Only superusers can delete organizations through the Django Admin interface.
- **Survey deletion**: Survey owners and organization admins can delete surveys they manage, following proper confirmation workflows.

**Rationale**: User and organization deletion can have cascading effects that permanently remove data belonging to multiple users. This restriction ensures:

1. **Data protection**: Prevents accidental loss of surveys and responses that may be shared with other users
2. **Audit compliance**: Maintains proper audit trails for account management actions
3. **Security**: Prevents malicious or compromised accounts from destroying organizational data
4. **Intentionality**: Ensures deletion decisions are made by administrators with full context

**For users needing account deletion**: Contact your system administrator, who can safely perform the deletion through the admin interface after confirming the impact on shared data.

## Testing

The test suite includes:

- JWT auth enforcement (missing/invalid tokens, refresh flow)
- API permission tests for list/detail/update/seed
- SSR portal tests for org/survey user management behaviors and permission boundaries

All tests are designed to ensure that protections are consistent and robust across SSR and API.
