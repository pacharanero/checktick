## Using the API

CheckTick provides a comprehensive REST API for programmatic access.

### Why Use the API?

- **Automation**: Create surveys programmatically
- **Integration**: Connect to other systems
- **Batch operations**: Create multiple surveys at once
- **Custom workflows**: Build custom data collection tools
- **Data export**: Automate data downloads
- **Analysis pipelines**: Feed data directly to analysis tools

### API Authentication

CheckTick uses **API tokens** for authentication.

#### Creating an API Token

1. Log in to CheckTick
2. Go to Account Settings → API
3. Click "Create API Token"
4. Name your token (e.g., "Python script", "R analysis")
5. Copy token (shown only once!)
6. Store securely (password manager, environment variable)

**Example token**: `ct_1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef`

**Security notes**:
- Never commit tokens to git
- Don't share tokens
- Rotate tokens periodically
- Revoke tokens when no longer needed

#### Using Your Token

Include token in `Authorization` header:

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Token ct_your_token_here" \
     https://checktick.example.com/api/v1/surveys/
```

Or in Python:

```python
import requests

headers = {
    'Authorization': 'Token ct_your_token_here'
}

response = requests.get(
    'https://checktick.example.com/api/v1/surveys/',
    headers=headers
)
```

from io import StringIO

API_BASE = 'https://checktick.example.com/api/v1'
TOKEN = 'ct_your_token_here'

headers = {
    'Authorization': f'Token {TOKEN}'
}

# Close survey first
survey_slug = 'patient-satisfaction-survey'

requests.post(
    f'{API_BASE}/surveys/{survey_slug}/close/',
    headers=headers
)

# Export data
params = {
    'format': 'csv',
    'purpose': 'Data analysis for quality improvement report'
}

response = requests.get(
    f'{API_BASE}/surveys/{survey_slug}/export/',
    params=params,
    headers=headers
)

# Load into pandas
df = pd.read_csv(StringIO(response.text))
print(df.head())
print(f"Total responses: {len(df)}")
```

#### R: Fetch and Analyze Data

```r
library(httr)
library(jsonlite)
library(dplyr)

API_BASE <- 'https://checktick.example.com/api/v1'
TOKEN <- 'ct_your_token_here'

# Export data
response <- GET(
  paste0(API_BASE, '/surveys/patient-satisfaction-survey/export/'),
  query = list(
    format = 'json',
    purpose = 'Statistical analysis'
  ),
  add_headers(Authorization = paste('Token', TOKEN))
)

data <- content(response, as = 'parsed')

# Convert to dataframe
df <- data$responses %>%
  lapply(function(r) as.data.frame(r$data)) %>%
  bind_rows()

# Analyze
summary(df)
mean(df$satisfaction_rating)
```

#### Bash: Automated Survey Creation

```bash
#!/bin/bash

API_BASE="https://checktick.example.com/api/v1"
TOKEN="ct_your_token_here"

# Create survey
curl -X POST "$API_BASE/surveys/" \
  -H "Authorization: Token $TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "Weekly Audit Survey",
    "questions": [
      {
        "text": "Number of patients seen",
        "type": "number",
        "required": true
      },
      {
        "text": "Any incidents?",
        "type": "boolean",
        "required": true
      }
    ]
  }' | jq '.'
```

### API Rate Limits

To prevent abuse, the API has rate limits:

- **Individual accounts**: 100 requests/hour
- **Organization accounts**: 1,000 requests/hour

Rate limit headers in response:
```
X-RateLimit-Limit: 100
X-RateLimit-Remaining: 95
X-RateLimit-Reset: 1642589400
```

If rate limit exceeded:
```json
{
  "error": "Rate limit exceeded",
  "retry_after": 3600
}
```

### API Versioning

CheckTick uses URL versioning:
- Current version: `/api/v1/`
- Future versions will use `/api/v2/`, etc.

Old API versions are supported for at least 12 months after new version release.
