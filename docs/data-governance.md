## Overview

### What is Data Governance?

Data governance is the framework that ensures survey data is:
- **Secure** - Protected from unauthorized access
- **Compliant** - Meets legal and regulatory requirements
- **Controlled** - Only accessible to authorized people
- **Time-limited** - Not kept longer than necessary
- **Audited** - All access is logged and traceable

### Why Does It Matter?

When you collect survey data, especially in healthcare, you may be handling sensitive or personal information. Good data governance protects:
- **Participants** - Their privacy and confidentiality
- **Your organization** - From data breaches and compliance violations
- **You** - From legal liability and reputational damage

### Key Principles

#### 1. Access Control

Not everyone can access survey data. Access is strictly controlled based on roles:

| Role | Can View Responses | Can Download Data | Can Extend Retention |
|------|-------------------|-------------------|---------------------|
| **Survey Creator** | ✅ Own surveys | ✅ Own surveys | ✅ Own surveys |
| **Organization Owner** | ✅ All org surveys | ✅ All org surveys | ✅ All org surveys |
| **Data Custodian*** | ❌ No | ✅ Assigned surveys | ❌ No |
| **Editor** | ❌ No | ❌ No | ❌ No |
| **Viewer** | ❌ No | ❌ No | ❌ No |

\* *Optional role - can be assigned per survey for data management delegation*

#### 2. Survey Closure

Data can only be downloaded after a survey has been formally **closed**. Closing a survey:
- Locks all responses (no further edits)
- Enables data export functionality
- Starts the retention countdown
- Triggers automatic deletion warnings

This ensures data is only extracted when collection is complete.

#### 3. Time-Limited Storage

Survey data is **not kept indefinitely**. By default:
- Data is kept for **6 months** after survey closure
- You receive warnings at **1 month**, **1 week**, and **1 day** before deletion
- Data is automatically deleted unless you extend retention
- Maximum retention period is **24 months**

#### 4. Audit Trail

Every data access is logged:
- Who downloaded data
- When they downloaded it
- What survey data was downloaded
- Their stated purpose
- Their IP address

Organization administrators receive email notifications for all data downloads.

#### 5. User Responsibility

When you download data, you become responsible for:
- Storing it securely (encrypted, password-protected location)
- Not sharing it inappropriately
- Deleting it when no longer needed
- Reporting any data breaches
- Complying with your organization's data policies

### Data Lifecycle

## Data Export

### How to Download Survey Data

Data can only be exported after a survey has been **closed**. This ensures all responses are finalized before extraction.

### Step 1: Close the Survey

1. Navigate to your survey dashboard
2. Click "Close Survey" button
3. Confirm the closure (this action is permanent)
4. The survey is now locked - no further responses accepted

### Step 2: Request Data Export

1. Click the "Export Data" button on the closed survey dashboard
2. Select your export format:
   - **CSV** - Spreadsheet format, one row per response
   - **JSON** - Structured format for programmatic use
   - **Excel** - Formatted workbook with multiple sheets
3. Enter a **purpose statement** (required):
   - Example: "Annual report analysis"
   - Example: "Research paper dataset"
   - Example: "Quality improvement review"

### Step 3: Confirm Download

1. Review the data governance checklist:
   - ☐ I have a legitimate need to download this data
   - ☐ I will store this data securely
   - ☐ I will not share this data inappropriately
   - ☐ I will delete this data when no longer needed
2. Check all boxes to proceed
3. Click "Download"

### Step 4: Secure Storage

After downloading:
1. **Immediately encrypt** the file (password-protected ZIP or encrypted drive)
2. Store in a secure location:
   - Encrypted fileserver
   - Password-protected cloud storage
   - Locked, encrypted laptop
3. **Do not** store on:
   - Unencrypted USB drives
   - Public cloud storage (Dropbox, Google Drive without encryption)
   - Shared network drives without access controls
4. **Delete** from your downloads folder after securing

### Export Formats

#### CSV Format

- One row per survey response
- Columns for each question
- Includes metadata (timestamp, user ID, IP address if available)
- Compatible with Excel, R, Python pandas, SPSS

**Example**:
```csv
response_id,timestamp,user_id,q1_name,q1_age,q2_diagnosis
uuid-1,2025-01-15 14:30,user123,John,45,Type 2
uuid-2,2025-01-16 09:15,user456,Jane,38,Type 1
```

#### JSON Format

- Nested structure preserving question groups
- Full metadata included
- Ideal for programmatic processing
- Preserves data types

**Example**:
```json
{
  "survey": {
    "id": "uuid",
    "name": "Diabetes Survey",
    "closed_at": "2025-01-20T10:00:00Z"
  },
  "responses": [
    {
      "id": "response-uuid",
      "timestamp": "2025-01-15T14:30:00Z",
      "user_id": "user123",

        },
        "clinical": {
          "diagnosis": "Type 2"
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

#### Excel Format

- Multiple sheets:
  - Sheet 1: Responses (one row per response)
  - Sheet 2: Questions (data dictionary)
  - Sheet 3: Metadata (survey info, export timestamp)
- Formatted with headers and data types
- Suitable for non-technical users

### Audit Trail

Every data export creates an audit log entry with:
- **Who** - User ID and name
- **When** - Exact timestamp
- **What** - Survey ID and name
- **Why** - Purpose statement
- **Where** - IP address
- **How** - Export format

Organization owners receive email notifications for all data exports:

```
Subject: Data Export: Diabetes Survey

User: john.smith@example.com
Survey: Diabetes Survey
Time: 2025-01-20 10:30:00 GMT
Purpose: Annual report analysis
Format: CSV
IP: 192.0.2.1

View full audit log: [link]
```

### Re-Downloading Data

You can download data multiple times:
- No limit on number of exports
- Each export creates a new audit log entry
- Must provide a purpose statement each time
- Organization owners notified for each download

This allows:
- Correcting failed downloads
- Sharing with additional authorized colleagues
- Regenerating exports after data updates (if survey reopened)

### Data Deletion After Export

Exporting data does **not** prevent automatic deletion:
- Retention countdown continues after export
- Downloaded files are **your responsibility**
- System will still auto-delete at scheduled time
- To keep data longer, extend retention period (see Retention Policy)

---

## Retention Policy

### Default Retention Period

Survey data is kept for **6 months** after survey closure.

```
Survey Closed → [6 months] → Automatic Deletion
```

### Retention Timeline

| Time After Closure | Action |
|-------------------|--------|
| **Day 0** | Survey closed, retention countdown begins |
| **5 months** | First warning email sent (1 month remaining) |
| **5 months 3 weeks** | Second warning (1 week remaining) |
| **5 months 29 days** | Final warning (1 day remaining) |
| **6 months** | **Automatic deletion** - permanent and irreversible |

### Warning Emails

At each warning milestone, emails are sent to:
- Survey creator
- Organization owner
- All assigned data custodians

**Email content**:
```
Subject: WARNING: Survey data will be deleted in 1 month

Survey: Diabetes Patient Feedback
Responses: 234
Deletion date: 2025-07-20

Options:
1. Download data now (if not already done)
2. Extend retention (up to 24 months total)
3. Allow deletion to proceed

[Download Data] [Extend Retention]
```

### Extending Retention

You can extend retention up to a **maximum of 24 months** total.

#### How to Extend

1. Go to survey dashboard
2. Click "Extend Retention"
3. Select new retention period:
   - 12 months
   - 18 months
   - 24 months
4. Provide justification (required):
   - Example: "Ongoing research study, manuscript in preparation"
   - Example: "Legal requirement for 2-year record retention"
   - Example: "Audit pending, data required for evidence"
5. Click "Extend"

#### Justification Requirements

Extensions must be justified because:
- Data minimization principle (GDPR)
- Storage costs
- Security risk (older data, more exposure)
- Compliance requirements

Poor justifications (will be rejected):
- "Just in case"
- "Might need it later"
- "No specific reason"

Good justifications:
- "Longitudinal study, 2-year follow-up planned"
- "Regulatory requirement for clinical trial data"
- "Awaiting ethics committee review"

#### Extension Limits

- Can extend multiple times (up to 24 months total)
- Each extension requires new justification
- Organization owners can review all extensions
- Audit log records all extension requests

### Maximum Retention Period

Data **cannot** be kept longer than 24 months except:
1. **Legal hold** (see Special Cases)
2. **Legal obligation** (e.g., clinical trial regulations)

After 24 months:
- Must download data if needed
- System will force deletion
- No further extensions allowed

### Automatic Deletion Process

When the retention period expires:

1. **Database deletion**:
   - All survey responses removed
   - Participant data deleted
   - Question group data retained (for survey structure)
   
2. **Backup deletion**:
   - Data removed from all backups within 30 days
   - Follows backup rotation schedule
   
3. **Audit log retention**:
   - Audit logs kept for 7 years (compliance requirement)
   - Personal data redacted
   - Metadata retained (who, when, what action)

4. **Confirmation email**:
   ```
   Subject: Survey data deleted: Diabetes Survey

   The survey "Diabetes Survey" has been automatically deleted.

   - Responses deleted: 234
   - Deletion date: 2025-07-20
   - Reason: Retention period expired

   This action is permanent and cannot be undone.
   ```

### Early Deletion

Survey creators can delete data **before** the retention period expires:

1. Go to survey dashboard
2. Click "Delete Survey Data"
3. Confirm deletion (requires typing survey name)
4. Data immediately removed

This is useful for:
- Accidentally closed surveys
- Completed analysis, data no longer needed
- Participant withdrawal requests

### Retention Policy Override

Only **organization owners** can place a **legal hold** to prevent automatic deletion (see Special Cases section).

## Security Best Practices

### Protecting Downloaded Data

When you export survey data, you become the **data controller**. This section explains how to protect that data.

### Storage Security

#### Recommended Storage Locations

✅ **Secure Options**:
- Institutional encrypted file server
- Password-protected encrypted cloud storage (OneDrive for Business, Google Workspace with encryption)
- Encrypted external hard drive in locked cabinet
- Password-protected laptop with full-disk encryption
- Secure research data management system (e.g., REDCap, institutional repository)

❌ **Insecure Options**:
- Unencrypted USB drives
- Personal Dropbox/Google Drive (without encryption)
- Email attachments
- Shared network drives without access controls
- Unencrypted laptop
- Cloud storage with weak passwords

#### Encryption Requirements

**All exported data must be encrypted.**

##### Option 1: Password-Protected ZIP (Easy)

```bash
# macOS/Linux
zip -er survey_data.zip survey_data.csv

# Windows (use 7-Zip)
7z a -p -mhe=on survey_data.7z survey_data.csv
```

Use a **strong password**:
- Minimum 16 characters
- Mix of letters, numbers, symbols
- Not related to survey content
- Store password in password manager (not with the file)

##### Option 2: Full-Disk Encryption (Better)

- **macOS**: FileVault
- **Windows**: BitLocker
- **Linux**: LUKS

This encrypts your entire hard drive, protecting all files automatically.

##### Option 3: Encrypted Folder (Best for Shared Systems)

- **macOS**: Create encrypted disk image (Disk Utility)
- **Windows**: Use VeraCrypt
- **Linux**: Use eCryptfs or VeraCrypt

### Access Controls

#### Who Should Have Access?

Only people with a **legitimate need** should access the data:

✅ **Appropriate**:
- Research team members listed on ethics approval
- Quality improvement team members
- Audit committee members (if auditing the service)
- Data analyst assigned to the project

❌ **Inappropriate**:
- Colleagues not involved in the project
- Students not listed on ethics approval
- External collaborators without data sharing agreement
- IT support staff (unless specifically authorized)

#### Sharing Data Securely

If you need to share data with authorized colleagues:

1. **Verify authorization**: Ensure they're listed on ethics approval/data sharing agreement
2. **Use secure transfer**:
   - Institutional file sharing with access controls
   - Encrypted email (S/MIME or PGP)
   - Secure file transfer service (e.g., institutional Dropbox alternative)
3. **Log the transfer**: Document who, what, when, why
4. **Remind recipient** of their data protection obligations

**Never**:
- Send unencrypted email attachments
- Upload to public file sharing sites
- Share passwords in the same message as encrypted files
- Post in Slack/Teams without encryption

### Data Processing Security

When analyzing data:

1. **Use secure computing environments**:
   - Password-protected computer
   - Private workspace (not public café)
   - Screen privacy filter if working in shared spaces
   - Lock computer when stepping away

2. **Minimize data copies**:
   - Work with data in one location
   - Delete temporary files
   - Clear clipboard after copying sensitive data
   - Don't save to Downloads folder

3. **Anonymize early**:
   - Remove names, email addresses, IP addresses as soon as possible
   - Replace with participant IDs
   - Store linking file separately (encrypted)

4. **Version control**:
   - Use clear file naming (diabetes_survey_v1.csv)
   - Document changes (data_cleaning_log.txt)
   - Don't keep unnecessary old versions

### Data Destruction

When you no longer need the data:

1. **Verify retention requirements**: Check ethics approval, institutional policy, legal obligations
2. **Delete all copies**:
   - Original export file
   - Working copies
   - Analysis files
   - Temporary files
   - Backup copies
3. **Secure deletion**:
   - Empty Trash/Recycle Bin
   - Use secure delete tools (macOS: `srm`, Windows: `cipher`, Linux: `shred`)
   - If on encrypted drive, deletion is sufficient
4. **Document destruction**:
   - Record date of deletion
   - Record who deleted it
   - Keep destruction log for audit

### Physical Security

Protect physical access to devices:

- **Lock computer** when leaving desk (even briefly)
- **Secure laptops** in locked cabinet when not in use
- **Encrypt portable drives** before transporting
- **Report lost/stolen devices** immediately
- **Use privacy screens** in public spaces
- **Shred printed data** (cross-cut shredder)

### Incident Response

If data is lost, stolen, or accessed by unauthorized person:

1. **Immediate actions** (within minutes):
   - Disconnect affected device from network
   - Change passwords
   - Notify organization IT security team

2. **Within 24 hours**:
   - Document incident (what, when, how)
   - Notify organization data protection officer
   - Notify survey participants if required
   - Notify regulatory bodies if required (e.g., ICO for UK)

3. **Investigation**:
   - Determine scope of breach
   - Identify affected individuals
   - Assess risk to participants
   - Implement additional security measures

4. **Legal requirements**:
   - GDPR requires breach notification within 72 hours
   - Must notify affected individuals if high risk to their rights
   - Maintain breach register

### Compliance Checklist

Before downloading data, ensure:

- [ ] You have a legitimate need to download this data
- [ ] You have appropriate authorization (ethics approval, data sharing agreement)
- [ ] You have secure storage available (encrypted location)
- [ ] You understand your data protection responsibilities
- [ ] You know your organization's data security policies
- [ ] You have access to secure analysis environment
- [ ] You know who to contact in case of security incident

## Special Cases

### Legal Holds

A **legal hold** is a mechanism to prevent automatic deletion of survey data when there is a legal or regulatory requirement to preserve evidence.

#### When to Use Legal Holds

Legal holds should only be used in specific circumstances:

✅ **Appropriate use cases**:
- Active litigation involving the survey data
- Regulatory investigation (e.g., ICO, Care Quality Commission)
- Freedom of Information request
- Subject Access Request requiring complex data retrieval
- Criminal investigation
- Parliamentary inquiry
- Serious incident investigation

❌ **Inappropriate use cases**:
- "Just in case we need it later"
- Avoiding normal retention policies
- Ongoing research (use retention extension instead)
- General audit purposes (use retention extension)

#### Who Can Place a Legal Hold?

Only **organization owners** can place legal holds.

**Why this restriction?**
- Legal holds override normal data minimization principles
- Require documented legal justification
- Subject to audit and review
- Potential compliance implications

#### How to Place a Legal Hold

1. Navigate to survey dashboard
2. Click "Place Legal Hold" (only visible to org owners)
3. Provide detailed justification:
   - Legal basis (litigation, investigation, etc.)
   - Case reference number
   - Expected duration
   - Contact information for legal counsel
4. Attach supporting documentation (optional but recommended)
5. Click "Confirm Legal Hold"

**Example justification**:
```
Case: Smith v. NHS Trust (Case No. 2025-1234)
Basis: Active litigation
Solicitor: Jane Doe, ABC Law Firm (jane@abclaw.com)
Expected duration: 18 months (trial scheduled July 2026)
Notes: Survey responses may be required as evidence.
```

#### Legal Hold Effects

When a legal hold is active:
- **Automatic deletion suspended** - data will not be deleted
- **Warnings suppressed** - no deletion warning emails sent
- **No retention limit** - can be held indefinitely
- **Audit trail updated** - all holds logged
- **Organization notified** - org owner receives confirmation email

#### Reviewing and Lifting Legal Holds

Legal holds should be reviewed regularly:

1. **Monthly review**: Organization owner checks all active holds
2. **Verify continued need**: Contact legal counsel to confirm hold still required
3. **Lift hold when appropriate**:
   - Navigate to survey dashboard
   - Click "Lift Legal Hold"
   - Provide reason for lifting
   - Data immediately subject to normal retention policy

After lifting:
- Retention countdown resumes from where it left off
- Deletion warnings sent if close to deadline
- Can be placed again if needed

#### Legal Hold Audit Trail

All legal hold actions are logged:
- Who placed the hold
- When it was placed
- Justification provided
- When it was lifted (if applicable)
- Reason for lifting

Organization owners can view legal hold reports showing:
- All active legal holds
- Hold duration
- Surveys affected
- Estimated data volume

### Ownership Transfer

When a survey creator leaves the organization or changes roles, survey ownership may need to be transferred.

#### Automatic Transfer

Surveys automatically transfer to the **organization owner** when:
- Survey creator's account is deactivated
- Survey creator leaves the organization (membership revoked)
- Survey creator requests transfer

**Automatic transfer process**:
1. System detects creator account deactivation
2. Ownership transfers to organization owner
3. Both parties notified via email (if possible)
4. Audit log records transfer
5. All permissions preserved

**Email notification**:
```
Subject: Survey ownership transferred

The survey "Diabetes Survey" has been transferred to you.

Previous owner: john.smith@example.com (deactivated)
New owner: you@example.com
Transfer date: 2025-02-01

You now have full control over this survey.
```

#### Manual Transfer

Survey creators can manually transfer ownership:

1. Navigate to survey dashboard
2. Click "Transfer Ownership"
3. Select new owner (must be organization member)
4. Provide reason for transfer
5. New owner receives notification and must accept

**Transfer confirmation**:
- New owner must explicitly accept
- All data access permissions retained
- Original creator loses owner permissions (becomes Editor)
- Cannot be reversed without another transfer

#### Transfer Implications

**For the new owner**:
- Full survey control
- Data download permission
- Retention management
- All future emails (warnings, exports, etc.)

**For the previous owner**:
- Automatically becomes Editor (can modify survey structure)
- Loses data access
- No longer receives deletion warnings
- Can be removed entirely by new owner

#### Organization Dissolution

If an organization is deleted:
- All surveys automatically transfer to individual survey creators
- Organization-level encryption removed (if applicable)
- Each creator becomes independent owner
- All creators notified

### Data Custodian Role

The **Data Custodian** role allows delegation of data management without granting full survey control.

#### When to Use Data Custodians

✅ **Appropriate use cases**:
- Research data manager responsible for data exports
- Quality improvement lead who analyzes data
- Audit committee member who reviews data
- Delegate who handles data while you're on leave

❌ **Not appropriate for**:
- Survey editors (use Editor role)
- People who should view responses in UI (use organization membership)
- General collaborators (use Viewer role)

#### Assigning a Data Custodian

1. Navigate to survey dashboard
2. Click "Manage Users"
3. Click "Assign Data Custodian"
4. Enter email address or select from organization members
5. Optionally provide note explaining why
6. Click "Assign"

**Custodian receives email**:
```
Subject: You've been assigned as Data Custodian

Survey: Diabetes Survey
Organization: NHS Trust Research
Assigned by: john.smith@example.com

As Data Custodian, you can:
- Download data exports
- View audit logs

#### Removing Data Custodians

Survey creators or organization owners can remove custodians:

1. Navigate to survey dashboard
2. Click "Manage Users"
3. Find custodian in list
4. Click "Remove"
5. Confirm removal

**Removal email**:
```
Subject: Data Custodian access removed

You no longer have Data Custodian access to:

Survey: Diabetes Survey
Organization: NHS Trust Research
Removed by: john.smith@example.com
Date: 2025-02-01
```

### Emergency Data Access

In rare circumstances, organization owners may need emergency access to survey data.

#### Emergency Access Scenarios

- Survey creator suddenly unavailable (illness, emergency)
- Critical incident requiring immediate data review
- Data breach investigation
- Safeguarding concern

#### Emergency Access Procedure

1. **Organization owner** can access any organization survey
2. Emergency access automatically logged
3. Survey creator notified (if possible)
4. Requires documented justification post-access

**Emergency access audit entry**:
```
Emergency data access
User: admin@example.com (Organization Owner)
Survey: Diabetes Survey
Time: 2025-02-01 15:30:00
Reason: Creator unavailable, urgent data needed for incident investigation
Notification: Survey creator notified via email
```

### Participant Withdrawal

If a survey participant requests their data be removed:

#### Right to Erasure (GDPR)

Participants have the right to request deletion of their data if:
- They withdraw consent
- Data no longer necessary for original purpose
- They object to processing
- Data processed unlawfully

#### Withdrawal Process

1. Participant contacts survey creator/organization
2. Verify identity (ensure request is genuine)
3. Locate response (using timestamp, email, or other identifier)
4. Delete specific response:
   - Navigate to survey responses
   - Find participant's response
   - Click "Delete Response"
   - Document reason: "Participant withdrawal request"
5. Confirm deletion to participant

#### Deletion Limitations

Cannot delete if:
- Data already anonymized (cannot identify individual response)
- Legal obligation to retain (e.g., clinical trial regulations)
- Public interest (e.g., public health research)
- Exercise/defense of legal claims

If deletion not possible, must inform participant and explain why.

#### Partial Deletion

Participant can request:
- Deletion of specific questions
- Anonymization instead of deletion
- Restricted processing (mark as "do not use")

Document all requests and actions taken.

## Implementation

This section provides technical details for developers implementing data governance features.

### Database Schema

#### Survey Model

```python
class Survey(models.Model):
    # Core fields
    name = models.CharField(max_length=255)
    owner = models.ForeignKey(User, on_delete=models.PROTECT)
    organization = models.ForeignKey(Organization, null=True, on_delete=models.SET_NULL)
    
    # Lifecycle
    status = models.CharField(max_length=20, choices=STATUS_CHOICES)
    # choices: 'draft', 'published', 'closed', 'archived'
    
    created_at = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)
    closed_at = models.DateTimeField(null=True, blank=True)
    
    # Retention
    retention_period_months = models.IntegerField(default=6)
    deletion_scheduled_at = models.DateTimeField(null=True, blank=True)
    legal_hold = models.BooleanField(default=False)
    legal_hold_reason = models.TextField(blank=True)
    legal_hold_placed_at = models.DateTimeField(null=True, blank=True)
    legal_hold_placed_by = models.ForeignKey(User, null=True, on_delete=models.SET_NULL, related_name='legal_holds_placed')
```

#### Data Export Log

```python
class DataExportLog(models.Model):
    survey = models.ForeignKey(Survey, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    user = models.ForeignKey(User, on_delete=models.PROTECT)
    
    exported_at = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)
    export_format = models.CharField(max_length=10)  # 'csv', 'json', 'xlsx'
    purpose = models.TextField()
    
    ip_address = models.GenericIPAddressField()
    user_agent = models.TextField()
    
    # Compliance
    governance_acknowledged = models.BooleanField(default=False)
    terms_version = models.CharField(max_length=20)
```

#### Retention Extension Log

```python
class RetentionExtension(models.Model):
    survey = models.ForeignKey(Survey, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    user = models.ForeignKey(User, on_delete=models.PROTECT)
    
    extended_at = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)
    previous_deletion_date = models.DateTimeField()
    new_deletion_date = models.DateTimeField()
    
    justification = models.TextField()
    approved = models.BooleanField(default=True)
    approved_by = models.ForeignKey(User, null=True, on_delete=models.SET_NULL, related_name='retention_approvals')
```

### Permission Checks

#### View Decorator

```python
from functools import wraps
from django.core.exceptions import PermissionDenied

def require_data_access(view_func):
    """Require user has data download permission for survey."""
    @wraps(view_func)
    def wrapper(request, survey_slug, *args, **kwargs):
        survey = get_object_or_404(Survey, slug=survey_slug)
        
        # Check permissions
        if not (
            request.user == survey.owner or
            request.user == survey.organization.owner or
            survey.data_custodians.filter(user=request.user).exists()
        ):
            raise PermissionDenied("You do not have data access permission.")
        
        # Check survey is closed
        if survey.status != 'closed':
            raise PermissionDenied("Survey must be closed before data export.")
        
        return view_func(request, survey_slug, *args, **kwargs)
    
    return wrapper
```

#### Permission Helper Methods

```python
class Survey(models.Model):
    # ... fields ...
    
    def can_download_data(self, user):
        """Check if user has permission to download data."""
        if not self.is_closed():
            return False
        
        return (
            user == self.owner or
            user == self.organization.owner or
            self.data_custodians.filter(user=user).exists()
        )
    
    def can_extend_retention(self, user):
        """Check if user can extend retention period."""
        return (
            user == self.owner or
            user == self.organization.owner
        )
    
    def can_place_legal_hold(self, user):
        """Check if user can place legal hold."""
        return (
            self.organization and
            user == self.organization.owner
        )
```

### Scheduled Tasks

#### Deletion Warnings

```python
# celery tasks (schedule with celery beat)
from datetime import timedelta
from django.utils import timezone
from django.core.mail import send_mail

@celery.task
def send_deletion_warnings():
    """Send deletion warning emails at 1 month, 1 week, 1 day."""
    now = timezone.now()
    
    # Surveys to be deleted in 1 month
    one_month_surveys = Survey.objects.filter(
        deletion_scheduled_at__gte=now + timedelta(days=29),
        deletion_scheduled_at__lt=now + timedelta(days=31),
        legal_hold=False
    )
    
    for survey in one_month_surveys:
        send_deletion_warning(survey, days_remaining=30)
    
    # Surveys to be deleted in 1 week
    one_week_surveys = Survey.objects.filter(
        deletion_scheduled_at__gte=now + timedelta(days=6),
        deletion_scheduled_at__lt=now + timedelta(days=8),
        legal_hold=False
    )
    
    for survey in one_week_surveys:
        send_deletion_warning(survey, days_remaining=7)
    
    # Surveys to be deleted in 1 day
    one_day_surveys = Survey.objects.filter(
        deletion_scheduled_at__gte=now + timedelta(hours=22),
        deletion_scheduled_at__lt=now + timedelta(hours=26),
        legal_hold=False
    )
    
    for survey in one_day_surveys:
        send_deletion_warning(survey, days_remaining=1)

def send_deletion_warning(survey, days_remaining):
    """Send warning email to survey owner, org owner, and custodians."""
    recipients = [survey.owner.email]
    
    if survey.organization:
        recipients.append(survey.organization.owner.email)
    
    for custodian in survey.data_custodians.all():
        recipients.append(custodian.user.email)
    
    send_mail(
        subject=f'WARNING: Survey data will be deleted in {days_remaining} day(s)',
        message=f'Survey "{survey.name}" is scheduled for deletion.',
        from_email=settings.DEFAULT_FROM_EMAIL,
        recipient_list=list(set(recipients)),  # Remove duplicates
    )
```

#### Automatic Deletion

```python
@celery.task
def delete_expired_surveys():
    """Delete surveys whose retention period has expired."""
    now = timezone.now()
    
    expired_surveys = Survey.objects.filter(
        deletion_scheduled_at__lt=now,
        legal_hold=False
    )
    
    for survey in expired_surveys:
        delete_survey_data(survey)

def delete_survey_data(survey):
    """Permanently delete all survey responses."""
    # Delete all responses
    response_count = survey.responses.count()
    survey.responses.all().delete()
    
    # Log deletion
    DeletionLog.objects.create(
        survey=survey,
        deleted_at=timezone.now(),
        response_count=response_count,
        reason='retention_expired'
    )
    
    # Send confirmation email
    send_mail(
        subject=f'Survey data deleted: {survey.name}',
        message=f'{response_count} responses have been permanently deleted.',
        from_email=settings.DEFAULT_FROM_EMAIL,
        recipient_list=[survey.owner.email],
    )
    
    # Update survey status
    survey.status = 'archived'
    survey.save()
```

### Export Views

#### CSV Export

```python
import csv
from django.http import HttpResponse

@require_data_access
def export_csv(request, survey_slug):
    survey = get_object_or_404(Survey, slug=survey_slug)
    
    # Get purpose from form
    purpose = request.POST.get('purpose', '')
    if not purpose:
        return JsonResponse({'error': 'Purpose required'}, status=400)
    
    # Log export
    DataExportLog.objects.create(
        survey=survey,
        user=request.user,
        export_format='csv',
        purpose=purpose,
        ip_address=get_client_ip(request),
        user_agent=request.META.get('HTTP_USER_AGENT', ''),
        governance_acknowledged=True
    )
    
    # Send notification to org owner
    if survey.organization:
        notify_data_export(survey, request.user, 'csv', purpose)
    
    # Generate CSV
    response = HttpResponse(content_type='text/csv')
    response['Content-Disposition'] = f'attachment; filename="{survey.slug}_export.csv"'
    
    writer = csv.writer(response)
    
    # Write headers
    headers = ['response_id', 'timestamp', 'user_id']
    for question in survey.questions.all():
        headers.append(question.key)
    writer.writerow(headers)
    
    # Write data
    for response_obj in survey.responses.all():
        row = [
            response_obj.id,
            response_obj.created_at,
            response_obj.user_id or ''
        ]
        for question in survey.questions.all():
            value = response_obj.data.get(question.key, '')
            row.append(value)
        writer.writerow(row)
    
    return response
```
